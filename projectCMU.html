                        <p> Adam Causgrove, the Associate Director of Corporate Relations for CMU, wants a platform for the 
                            Dietrich College to catalog the many different ways external partners can work with faculty and 
                            students. <b>The purpose of this website is to showcase the many different ways external partners 
                            can work with faculty and students at Dietrich and to bridge the gap between Dietrich and external partners</b>. </p>

                        <p> Although similar sites exist for other schools or centers at CMU, such site currently doesn’t exist for 
                            Dietrich College. Therefore, extensive research was needed to understand my client’s goal and what 
                            information needs to be included in the site. Moreover, the constraint for the web design was that 
                            the layout of the site needs to conform to standard CMU communication policies.</p>

                        <p>We looked at existing websites from other colleges at CMU as well as other universities. This includes CMU’s Heinz College and Drexel 
                            University. Since such websites need to present a lot of information, we found that <b>some platforms such as Drexel University’s website 
                            tend to be too text heavy, which can discourage users from exploring the site.</b> This problem, however, is nicely addressed in Heinz 
                            website, where they utilize landing pictures and various interaction designs to make the site more visually appealing and interesting to explore.
                            Moreover, in Heinz College Website, links are made with a purpose: everything is aimed at external partners getting access to connecting with 
                            students or faculty.</p>

                        <p>During our first meeting with our client Adam, the associate director of corporate relations of Dietrich college, 
                            we understood that the main goal of the website is to advertise opportunities to engage with Dietrich. Based on that, 
                            we identified three user groups: external partners, CMU faculty and CMU staff. To better understand each group’s pain 
                            point and what their expectations are for the site, we conducted three preliminary interviews with representatives 
                            from our user groups. <br><br>
                            After synthesizing our interviews results, we found several <b>notable pain points</b>: 
                        </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Currently, most of the collaboration was established via personal connection/professional conference. There lacks a channel to find information about potential external partners</li>
                                <li>It is hard to find contact information about external partners therefore failed to reach out to them</li>
                                <li>Many staffs currently use a google spreadsheet to keep track of external partners’ information and reach out process, which can get messy </li>
                            </ol>
                        <p>Our interviewees also expressed their ideal vision on connecting with partners, and we’d like to narrow our focus down to these goals:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Having a way to help faculty connect with CMU alumni and non-profit organizations around Pittsburgh area</li>
                                <li>Showcasing projects and examples with executive summary & details so that it will be easier for staff to explain the projects to potential collaborators</li>
                                <li>Provide an option to tag and filter projects by categories, and also provide links to relevant resources such as past collaborations and contact information</li>

                            we utilized various pictures with succinct descriptions to present information.
                            Since the target audience for the site is working professionals, we believed that a desktop-first approach is

                        <p>Overall, I had a great experience working on the project! I loved the fact that I was able to use design and technology and solve a real world problem, and I was very glad that the stackholder likes the end product. I gained valuable experience regarding teamwork, 
                            such as how to communicate professionally, how to collaborate in this remote setting and how to keep track of deadlines and manage time. 
                            I also got a lot of experience on how to conduct user interviews, usability testing and how to work with clients and understand their needs. 
                            Lastly, I also honed my design and technical skills during the process.</p>

                    <p class="popout-desc"> Hello! I'm Wen Shan (she/her) and I'm a sophomore at CMU studying 
                        Information Systems. Fun fact, I actually started college as a chemistry major who has never 
                        written a single line of code. In my first semester at CMU, I took an introductory Computer Science course 
                        and I discovered how fun and creative the field of tech really is. I decided to transfer to Information Systems 
                        because I want to design and deliver innovative solutions to prevalent problems. <br>
                        <br>
                        I love baking, traveling, and skin care <i class="fas fa-grin-beam"></i><br>
